## My Personal Project

### *Proposal*

<p> I am planning to design an <strong>application manager</strong> 
which 
would store and track user's various applications. A 
user can input applications, their 
deadlines, and a list of the requirements for each one. 
They can also fill out applications inside the program
by uploading files from their computer. The program 
will show deadlines and progress on each one.
For example, a user is applying to many grad schools.
They can store and keep track of all their applications 
for each one of them as well as some required documents
(e.g. motivational essays, transcripts, etc.) </p>

<p> The program might be useful for people applying to
jobs, schools, visas, tax returns. It allows to manage
and collect documents for different applications in 
one place. Personally, I often have to apply for visas 
and having a program to store many required documents 
for them would be useful.</p>
